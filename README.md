# D20 Tactics v0.1

```
And in all ages a certain barbaric warfare has been waged with soldiers of tin and lead and wood - H. G. Wells

## Overview

D20 Tactics is a system for running large scale battles with the rules and content found in the Dungeons and Dragons *Player's Handbook*, *Monster Manual*, and *Dungeon Master's Guide* by Wizards of the Coast, or with the free (D&D System Reference Document)[/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf], from which some of these rules derive. They should also be compatible with most other D20 system games with a little bit of work.

These rules can be played as a standalone tabletop wargame in the manner of Games Workshop's *Warhammer* games and many others. They can be used for large combat scenarios within a game of Dungeons and Dragons or another 5th edition D20 system game. They can be used for a variety of scenario-based DM-adjudicated games not fitting neatly into either category. D20 Tactics is a toolbox.

There are 3 main rules modules. Each is fully independent of the other and entirely optional.

* [Partial Advantage and Tactical Position](/PARTIAL_ADVANTAGE_AND_TACTICAL_POSITION.md)

* [Formations of Creatures](/FORMATIONS_OF_CREATURES.md)

* [Chaos Initiative](/CHAOS_INITIATIVE.md)

## Playtesting thus far

In our own games, after 10 serious playtests and counting, we have found that the first module fits neatly into almost any combat where relevant. The second module is only necessary when a combat would have 30 or more creatures. And the 3rd substantially changes the game but greatly speeds up games with an unusually large number of players or a truly large (50-200) numbers of creatures on the field.
