# D20 Tactics v0.1.1

> "And in all ages a certain barbaric warfare has been waged with soldiers of tin and lead and wood." – H. G. Wells

## Overview

D20 Tactics is a supplemental rules system designed to manage large-scale battles using content from the *Player's Handbook*, *Monster Manual*, and *Dungeon Master's Guide* published by Wizards of the Coast, or the freely available [D&D System Reference Document](SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf), from which portions of these rules derive. The rules should also be compatible with other games using the 5th Edition D20 system, with minor adjustments.

These supplemental rules can be utilized as:

- A standalone tabletop tactical miniatures wargame, akin to Games Workshop's *Warhammer* series.
- A framework for running large combat encounters within Dungeons & Dragons or other D20-compatible games.
- A toolkit for designing wholly new ways to play miniatures battle.

D20 Tactics consists of three modular components, each fully independent and optional:

- [Partial Advantage and Tactical Position](/PARTIAL_ADVANTAGE_AND_TACTICAL_POSITION.md)
- [Formations of Creatures](/FORMATIONS_OF_CREATURES.md)
- [Chaos Initiative](/CHAOS_INITIATIVE.md)

## Playtesting Experience at v0.1.1

After conducting ten significant playtests and many short experimental skirmishes, we have found:

- The **Partial Advantage and Tactical Position** module integrates smoothly into virtually any relevant combat scenario.
- The **Formations of Creatures** module becomes beneficial primarily in combats involving more than approximately one or two dozen creatures.
- The **Chaos Initiative** module significantly alters the gameplay experience but greatly accelerates encounters featuring an exceptionally large number of participants, such as battles involving 50–200 creatures or with 8 or more players.

The system is designed to enhance fun at various scales. However, incorporating these modules into every combat is not necessary. Their utility shines in specialized, larger-scale scenarios.
