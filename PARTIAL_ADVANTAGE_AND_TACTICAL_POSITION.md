# Partial Advantage and Tactical Position

## Partial Advantage and Disadvantage

### D20 Tests with Partial Advantage

A roll may have partial advantage. Multiple instances of partial advantage do not stack, nor do they combine to become standard advantage. A roll with standard advantage or disadvantage cannot have partial advantage.

To make a D20 Test with Partial advantage, roll the D20 and a D4 and add the results together before adding any other modifiers. A roll is a critical success only if the D20 is a 20. Rerolls of this roll are made without partial advantage unless otherwise specified.

A rule or ability that removes advantage from a roll will also remove partial advantage.

Abilities that only apply to attack rolls made with advantage, such as a Rogue's Sneak Attack feature, **are** available on attacks made with partial advantage.

### D20 Tests with Partial Disadvantage

As with partial advantage, partial disadvantage does not combine or stack. A roll with standard advantage or disadvantage cannot also have partial disadvantage.

If a D20 Test has at least one source of partial disadvantage and at least one source of partial advantage, it is not modified by either.

To make a D20 Test with Partial disadvantage, roll the D20 and a D4. If the D20 shows a 20, ignore the D4, otherwise subtract D4 from the roll before applying other modifiers.

A rule or ability that removes disadvantage from a roll will also remove partial disadvantage.

## Tactical Position

### High Ground

When making a ranged attack against a target within short range from a standing terrain elevation 10 ft. or more above an enemy's elevation, make the attack with partial advantage.

When making a melee attack against a target within the reach of the attack from a standing terrain elevation 2 ft. or more above an enemy's elevation, make the attack with partial advantage.

Elevation differences resulting from aerial position or swimming position under water do not make the attack with partial advantage.

### Flanking

When you attack a creature you are adjacent to, if another of that creature's enemies is adjacent to a diffent edge of that creature's square base, you make a flanking attack. That attack has partial advantage.

## Tactical Position (further options)

*These rules conflict with the core rules presented in the Dungeons and Dragons **Player's Handbook** and the System Reference Document, and are intended to be even more optional than the rest of this section*

### Half Cover

An attack made against a creature with half cover has partial disadvantage. This replaces the +2 to AC.

### Lightly Obscured

An attack made against a creature that is lightly obscured (such as when in dim light) has partial disadvantage.

### Three-Quarters Cover

An attack made against a creature with three quarters cover has standard disadvantage. This replaces the +5 to AC.

### Difficult Terrain Etc.

Attacks against a creature occupying or passing through terrain or an obstacle that costs additional movement, such as climbing for a creature without a climb speed, receive partial advantage. Creatures in such a position make dexterity saves with partial disadvantage.

### "DM's Best Friend"

Partial advantage and partial disadvantage are only slightly greater adjustments to a roll than a +2 or -2 and may be used in circumstances not covered by publisehd rules when the DM feels that the chance of success or failure has increased due to circumstances.

## Note on Formations:

Creatures in a formation are subject to varying tactical position modifications to their attack and other rolls. For instance: if only some occupy high ground, then only those attack rolls are made with partial advantage.

The exception is with a shared dexterity save. The formation makes its save with the most *disadvantaged* positioning of the creatures in the formation. For instance, if every creature in a formation is behind 3/4 cover except for one occupying difficult terrain with no cover, they make a dexterity save with partial disadvantage.
