# Partial Advantage and Tactical Position

## Quick Reference

To roll with partial advantage or disadvantage, add or subtract a D4 from the D20 roll. Attacking from high ground, from a flanking position, or against a creature on difficult terrain grants partial advantage. Other circumstances may use these modifications as well.

## Partial Advantage and Disadvantage

### D20 Tests with Partial Advantage

1. A roll can benefit from partial advantage. Multiple instances of partial advantage do not stack or combine to form standard advantage. If a roll already has standard advantage or disadvantage, it cannot also have partial advantage.

2. To perform a D20 Test with partial advantage, roll a d20 and a d4, adding both results together before applying other modifiers. A critical success occurs only if the d20 roll is a 20. Unless otherwise noted, rerolls do not include partial advantage.

3. Any rule or effect that removes advantage from a roll also removes partial advantage.

4. Features requiring advantage on an attack roll, such as a Rogue’s Sneak Attack, function normally with partial advantage.

### D20 Tests with Partial Disadvantage

5. Partial disadvantage follows similar rules to partial advantage. It does not stack or combine into standard disadvantage. If a roll already has standard advantage or disadvantage, it cannot also have partial disadvantage.

6. A roll affected by both partial advantage and partial disadvantage simultaneously receives neither benefit nor penalty.

7. To perform a D20 Test with partial disadvantage, roll a d20 and a d4. If the d20 roll is 20, ignore the d4. Otherwise, subtract the d4 result from the d20 before applying other modifiers.

8. Any rule or effect that removes disadvantage from a roll also removes partial disadvantage.

## Tactical Position

### High Ground

1. A ranged attack made from at least 10 feet above the target's elevation within short range gains partial advantage.

2. A melee attack gains partial advantage when made from an elevation of at least 2 feet above the target and within the attacker's reach.

3. Elevation due to flight or underwater positioning does not grant partial advantage.

### Flanking

4. When making a melee attack, if you and an ally are adjacent to different edges of an enemy’s space, you make the attack with partial advantage.

## Additional Tactical Options

*These optional rules replace or conflict with core rules in the **Player’s Handbook** and the **System Reference Document** and should be considered highly optional.*

### Half Cover

1. Attacks against a creature with half cover have partial disadvantage, replacing the standard +2 bonus to AC.

### Lightly Obscured

2. Attacks against a creature in a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, have partial disadvantage.

### Three-Quarters Cover

3. Attacks against a creature with three-quarters cover have standard disadvantage, replacing the standard +5 bonus to AC.

### Difficult Terrain and Obstacles

4. Attacks targeting creatures occupying or moving through difficult terrain or obstacles that require additional movement, such as climbing without a climb speed, gain partial advantage.

5. Creatures occupying or moving through difficult terrain or obstacles that require additional movement make Dexterity saving throws with partial disadvantage.

### "DM's Best Friend"

6. Partial advantage and partial disadvantage slightly exceed the standard ±2 modifier. They can be used by the DM in circumstances not covered explicitly by published rules, reflecting situations where the likelihood of success or failure is moderately impacted by external conditions.
