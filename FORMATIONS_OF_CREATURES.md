# Formations of Creatures

Formations are designed to simplify record keeping and speed up play for larger numbers of creatures. For the most part, a formation is more restricted than the equivalent number of individual creatures, and thus formations need not be used for smaller fights.

## Definition

*A formation is one or more creatures with identical stat blocks sharing a shared restrictive status.*

*The DM or scenario determine which creatures begin combat in formation. Formations are only broken up or combined during combat by DM fiat.*

## Quick and Dirty Summary

* Formations are creatures with identical game state other than position and death with a shared HP pool. 

* As the HP pool is reduced to or below multiples of their individual HP maximum, creatures damaged that turn die.

* Creatures in formation share equal numbers of all resources, share status conditions, and share all other game effects and state other than position.

* They move and act individually on a shared turn, but must end their turn less than their movement speed apart from one another and must take the same actions every turn.

* If half or more of the creatures in a formation would gain an effect or status or condition, they all do, otherwise none of them do. If any creature in a formation spends a resource, all are considered to have spent the same resource.

## Detailed Rules

1. **Golden Rule of Formations**: Between any two turns or initiative positions within a shared turn, if two creatures not currently dead or making death saving throws in a formation exchanged places, there would be no game effect.

### Initiative

2. All creatures in a formation act on a single shared turn with a single shared initiative value. That initiative value can only be altered (such as via the Alert feat) if it is altered for at least half of the creatures in the formation, in which case all initiative for the formation is altered.

### Actions and Bonus Actions

3. On a given shared turn, each creature in a formation must make the same choices for their action or bonus action or else decline to act or use the bonus action. The exception is the attack, magic, or shove action which may select different targets, but must make the same choices in all other respects such as spell or weapon selection.

### Positioning

4. If any two creatures in the formation are more than their movement speed apart, the formation cannot take actions or bonus actions other than dash, dodge, or disengage.

5. While status effects and conditions are shared between all creatures in a formation (see below), the effects of position such as cover, difficult terrain, high ground, and so on are not. Attack rolls by and against creatures in formation consider their specific positioning for range and die roll modificiations etc.

### Status Effects and Conditions

6. If at the end of a turn (or initiative position within the Chaos Initiative shared turn), half or more of the creatures in a formation have a condition, such as prone, or effect, such as the ongoing effects of spells, class abilities, and magic items, then all of them gain the status effect or condition. If fewer have that effect or condition, they all lose it. The exception to this rule is the dead condition or dying status as described below.

### HP & Temporary HP pool

7. A formation begins combat with an HP pool usually equal to their individual maximumÂ HP multiplied by the number of creatures in the formation. It may not begin equal to or less than than the individual maximum HP multiplied by the number of creatures in the formation reduced by one.

8. A formation has a pool of temporary HP as well. If one or more creatures in a formation would gain temporary HP during a single turn (or initiative position within the Chaos Initiative shared turn), the player controlling that creature may elect to replace all current temporary HP with the sum of the temporary HP gained.

9. If one or more creatures would receive healing, add the total to the HP pool up to the number of non-dead creatures in the formation multiplied by their individual HP maximum.

### Damage and Death

10. If a creature in a formation receives damage, first reduce the shared temporary HP pool and then reduce the shared HP pool by the amount of damage received.

11. A damage effect such as a fireball, an attack, or a multiattack cannot do more damage than the number of creatures in the formation affected multiplied by their individual maximum HP.

12. A formation with half their starting HP pool or less is considered to all be bloodied.

13. When the HP pool drops to or below the current number of creatures in that formation reduced by one multiplied by their individual maximum HP, one or more creatures in that formation begin dying. This is a status that is not shared by the rest of the formation.

14. To figure our how many creatures begin dying, answer the question "What is the least number of creatures where that number times their individual maximum HP would be greater than their current HP?". Creatures begin dying until that many remain.

**For example:**

*A formation of 6 goblins with 10 individual maximum HP begin combat with 60 HP. If they are reduced to 50, one goblin would enter a state of dying, if they were reduced to 41, still only one goblin would begin dying. If on a later turn, they were reduced to 28 HP, an further 2 goblins would enter a state of dying.*

*Each time, the number of goblins not dead or dying multiplied by their individual maximum HP is equal to or greater than the current HP pool, but by no more than one individual HP maximum.*

This sounds complicated, but in practice it means that as the HP pool is reduced by multiples of the individual HP maximum, creatures begin dying.

15. When the rules call for one or more creatures to begin dying, the controlling player or DM should select the appropriate number of creatures from among those that received damage this turn. In unusual circumstances. If more creatures than received damage would begin dying, the controlling player chooses from among the remaining creatures that did not receive damage freely.

### Death Saving Throws

16. A creature from a formation that is dying must make a death saving throw at the end of each of its turns. The death save for creatures from formations is a DC 10 constitution save with all usual bonuses and modifiers. When the creature fails one save, it dies, and no amount of successful saves stabilize it.

17. If any creature in a formation ends its turn or the shared Chaos Initiative turn more than its speed away from a dying creature in the same formation, the dying creature instantly dies.

18. If any creature in a formation ends its turn or the shared Chaos Initiative turn more than its speed away from a stabilized creature from the same formation. The stabilized creature is removed from the encounter but alive afterward.

19. A creature in a formation that receives healing or is stabilized will not be considered dead at the end of combat, but it does not return to the fight unless the following condition is met:

20. If a formation is healed such that the HP pool exceeds the number of non-dying creatures multiplied by the individual maximum HP of the creatures, one or more dying or stabilized creatures revives and rejoins the formation in combat. This does not apply to dead creatures.

21. If a dead creature from a formation is revived such as by a spell, it is considered to be stabilized unless that effect also restores enough HP for it to return to combat by the above rule.

### Shared D20 Checks

22. Except for attack rolls, if creatures in a formation would need to make the same D20 check for the same cause, such as an athletics check to climb a wall or a saving throw to resist a Fireball spell, they make a single shared save. Use the worst save bonus and disadvantage or partial disadvantage any of those creatures would make individually for the roll.

### Reactions

23. If a creature in a formation takes a reaction such as making an opportunity attack or casting Shield, all the other creatures in that formation must take the same reaction during that turn or shared initiative position within the Chaos Initiative shared turn or else take no reactions until the start of their next turn.

### Equal resources

24. If at the end of any turn, the creatures in a formation differ in available resources, such as spell slots, uses per day of limited use powers, healing potions in their posession, and so on, they all have the lowest number of that resource any individual creature has.

## Movement Trays

*Movement trays may be used to keep formations clear on the battle grid, but have no game effect in and of themselves*
