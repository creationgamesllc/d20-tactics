# Chaos Initiative

*Digital tools are recommended for this module. A sample Python Jupyter notebook for quickly generating initiative orders is provided, and a more comprehensive tool is in development.*

## The big idea

Players write orders for the characters and creatures under their control prior to knowing the initiative order, which is determined fresh each turn. Orders may to a limited degree include contingencies for unknown battlefield state.

The DM then determines initiative for the turn and resolves each order in the appropriate sequence.

## Writing Orders

1. At the start of combat and each subsequent round, each player (including the DM) writes down orders for each creature or formation under their control.

2. Orders must clearly detail each creature's movement, action, bonus action, object interaction, and reaction for that round.

3. Orders **cannot** contain general conditional statements ("if this then that" structures). However, each component (movement, action, bonus action, and object interaction) may include exactly one explicit "or else" alternative, used only if the primary instruction becomes impossible.

4. Players may specify up to two potential reactions per creature per round, each clearly triggered.

**Examples:**

- "The orc warrior moves 30 feet toward the soldier formation, making a melee greataxe attack against an adjacent enemy, or else throws a javelin at the closest enemy within range."

- "The fighter moves adjacent to the closest enemy within their movement range or else 30 feet west, then makes a melee longsword attack against an adjacent enemy or else readies an attack triggered by an enemy moving adjacent."

- "The elf paladin moves adjacent to the animated armor and attacks using Divine Smite on a hit, or else uses Misty Step to teleport 30 feet beyond the large tree after the attack."

- "The wizard moves 30 feet toward the cleric, their familiar moves adjacent to the cleric, and the wizard uses a Magic action to cast Cure Wounds via Magic Initiate, delivered by the familiar. The wizard's reaction is either casting Counterspell if an enemy casts a damaging spell affecting more than one ally, or casting Protection from Elements if targeted by elemental damage (excluding cantrips)."

### Expanded Ready Action

5. A readied action may include available movement and bonus actions for that round, for example:

- "The militia archers ready an action to move into the southernmost eight spaces on the nearby hill once clear, then make short bow attacks against the closest enemy within range or else take the Dodge action."

6. You may specify your reaction to maintain a readied action from a previous turn, preventing other reactions for that round. This maintenance ends at your next turn's resolution.

## Resolving the Round

1. After orders are written, roll initiative for each creature in combat.

2. All creatures' turns start simultaneously at the round’s beginning for game rule purposes.

3. Clearly note all specified reactions before resolving turns.

4. Resolve each creature’s orders fully in descending order of initiative. Formations resolve simultaneously at their initiative.

5. All turns end simultaneously at the round’s conclusion.

6. *Multiattack*: If a target dies in the middle of a multiattack, remaining attacks target the nearest enemy within range. If melee targets are unavailable but ranged attacks are, remaining attacks switch to ranged, targeting the nearest enemy.

7. *Opportunity Attack*: Creatures without a specified reaction default to the first available opportunity attack.

8. *Ambiguous Targets*: If multiple targets satisfy conditions like "nearest enemy," select the target with the lowest initiative position.

9. *Movement*: Creatures follow their orders as closely as possible. The DM resolves ambiguous movements.

### Head-to-Head Gameplay without a DM

10. Players resolve their opponents' creature orders.

11. In head-to-head games, all character sheets, HP, spell slots, and similar resources are public at all times, along with all written orders after turn resolution begins.

12. Resolve orders in good faith, interpreting instructions with the intent of sensible and fair play. Clearly written orders help prevent disputes. D20 Tactics is a friendly, social game.
